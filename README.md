# gamepoints-ionic
An Ionic version of my favorite hello world app; GamePoints!

This app was originally created to support a Foosball game mode we created at work that supports more than 4 players. This game mode uses a rotation system where players win individually, not as a team, by gaining points until a certain amount has been reached. GamePoints allows us to keep track of the points.
